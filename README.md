  2) make sure both the time graph file or the xy graph file is in  <code>.csv</code> file format. Put all the csv file in the same directory as your python file
  3) In the respective python3 file you can go into the file and change the filename
  4) run in terminal  <code><b>python3 filename </b></code> where filename can be <code>make_timegraph.py</code> or <code>make_xygraph.py</code>

### Basic functionalities
1) make_timegraph.py - you can change the title, xlabel and ylabel by going into the file and changing <code>xlabel = "x_label", ylabel = "y_label", title = "title"</code> with your required xlabel, ylabel and title values.
2) make_xygraph.py - you can change the title <code>title = "title"</code> with required title by going into the file.
